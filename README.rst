Getting started
---------------

You must install the components using pip::

    $ git clone https://github.com/natea/valentunes.git
    $ virtualenv valentunes
    $ cd valentunes
    $ source bin/activate
    $ easy_install pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can start up Django with::

    $ cd vt
    $ ./manage.py runserver

Testing with Poster
-------------------

Download
`Poster <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/poster/>`_ this Firefox plugin.

And then pass a POST using the following as the content::

    {
        "interests": "Hello",
        "to_email": "",
        "from_name": "Anna",
        "intro_note": "",
        "to_phone": "",
        "from_email": "",
        "recipient_name": "Nate",
        "from_phone": ""
    }

Make sure that you set the Content-type to ``application/json``
The response should return the URL to the new object that was just created. i.e.::

     http://localhost:8000/api/card/10/

Testing with curl (don't use - this is deprecated)
-----------------

To add a new card via the API, type this command in the terminal::

    $ curl localhost:8000/api/card/ -F "from_name=Nate" -F "from_email=nate@valentun.es"
    {
        "interests": "",
        "to_email": "",
        "from_name": "Josh",
        "create_date": "2011-02-12 18:25:45",
        "intro_note": "",
        "_state": "<django.db.models.base.ModelState object at 0x1019b2910>",
        "to_phone": "",
        "from_email": "nate@valentun.es",
        "recipient_name": "",
        "from_phone": "",
        "id": 3
    }

Now fetch that record you just created::

    $ curl localhost:8000/api/3/
    {
        "interests": "",
        "to_email": "",
        "from_name": "Nate",
        "create_date": "2011-02-12 18:25:45",
        "intro_note": "",
        "_state": "<django.db.models.base.ModelState object at 0x1019b2c90>",
        "to_phone": "",
        "from_email": "nate@valentun.es",
        "recipient_name": "",
        "from_phone": "",
        "id": 3

If you want to delete the record, type this command::

    $ curl-X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/1/
